## Nash Equilibrium

A **Nash equilibrium** is a key concept in game theory that represents a **stable state** in a strategic interaction where **no player has an incentive to deviate unilaterally from their current strategy**. A Nash equilibrium occurs when:

- **Mutual Best Responses**: Each player's strategy is optimal, given the strategies of the others.
- **No Regret**: Once the equilibrium is reached, no player regrets their choice, as switching strategies unilaterally would not yield a better outcome.
- **Existence**: In games with a finite number of players and strategies, at least one Nash equilibrium (in mixed strategies) always exists, as proven by John Nash.
